        n = len(nums)
        # To calculate the sum , if need to go through the entire array , hence the for loop.
        # The i loop will compute the first integer and j loop will keep track of the second integer.
        # Using(n-1) as the len() function indexes from 0 , so have to subtract 1.
        for i in range (n-1):
        # As specfied in the problem , we need to two seprate integer , hence (i+1), otherwise it will reitrate the first integer and compute the sum.

                if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:

        # Use case , if no actual sum is possible , return an empty array
        return[]
